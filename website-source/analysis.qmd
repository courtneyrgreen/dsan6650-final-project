## 6.1 PPO Behavior

- PPO strongly internalizes wait/abandon/waste penalties, choosing conservative baking that reduces waste but increases waits and abandonment, lowering profit.

## 6.2 Reward–Metric Misalignment

- Business score (profit) is not the same as the RL reward (profit minus penalties).
- Under capacity constraints, the most profitable behavior (aggressive stocking) conflicts with low-waste incentives in the reward.

## 6.3 Pricing Bandit Ineffectiveness

- Penalty-based metric: price adjustments do not overcome serving bottlenecks; behavior remains penalty‑driven.
- Profit‑only bandit: shifts toward profit (profit ↑, waste ↑) as expected, but remains far from Newsvendor.

## 6.4 Ablation (optional)

- PPO+Par (opening par selection) underperformed with our current par set and costs; further tuning or longer training may help but did not beat PPO in this study.



Key takeaways from each paper (for your Discussion and Intro)
1. Nomura et al. (2025) — PPO for perishable goods

Takeaways:

PPO performs well only when the reward exactly matches the target metric.

DRL can approximate DP but only if penalties are balanced properly.

Age-dependent demand makes pricing impactful; in your bakery environment, pricing has weak leverage because the bottleneck is capacity, not demand.

Supports your result: PPO didn’t “fail,” it optimized the wrong objective.

2. van Hezewijk (2024) — RL in service/queueing systems

Takeaways:

RL agents overweight penalized terms (wait costs, abandonment, congestion).

Policies may look suboptimal on profit while being optimal on the specified reward.

Waste-aversion behavior is common when leftover penalties dominate.

This is exactly why your PPO collapsed into “under-produce, minimize waste” mode.

3. Genalti (2021) — Bandit dynamic pricing

Takeaways:

Bandits work when elasticity matters; they fail when demand is bottlenecked elsewhere.

Pricing is only useful when elasticity exists; if service rate throttles throughput, price does nothing.

This matches your results: the pricing bandit provided little benefit.
