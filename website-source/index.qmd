# Bellman's Bakery

A cute pastel “Tiny Bakery Tycoon” reinforcement learning project. Each episode is one day at a small bakery with 2 ovens, limited capacity, 5 pastries, and real-time queues. Customers arrive with skewed preferences and varying patience. The agent plans baking and serving to maximize profit while minimizing waits, abandonment, and waste.

What’s inside:

- Methods: PPO with action masking (deep RL) + small Thompson-sampling bandits for daily decisions (shallow RL).
- Results: Comparison vs heuristic baselines (bake-to-par, greedy-queue, newsvendor) and ablations (price bandit, par bandit).
- Viewer: A minimal Pygame viewer for a cute visual of the day.

Repo: `bellmans_bakery` environment and consolidated `scripts/*` runner in this project.
