## Conclusion

- Newsvendor achieves the highest profit by over-producing and accepting waste.
- PPO optimizes a composite welfare objective; it reduces waste but suffers high waits/abandonment → lower profit.
- Price bandit changes the trade-off slightly; profit‑only alignment helps modestly but cannot overcome serving bottlenecks.

## Future Work

- Curriculum (stationary → non‑stationary), longer horizons.
- Smarter par selection and limited restocks; contextual bandits.
- Reward shaping aligned more tightly with profit and service SLAs.
- Capacity-focused changes (serve batching policies, oven setups).
