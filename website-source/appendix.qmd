## A. Hyperparameters

- PPO: n_steps=2048, batch_size=256, gamma=0.995, gae_lambda=0.95, ent_coef=0.01.
- Bandit arms: {0.9,1.0,1.1} (penalty metric), {0.7,0.85,1.0,1.15,1.3} (profit metric).

## B. Environment Configurations

- serve_per_tick=3; 2 ovens, capacity 4u each; patience 30–90s; queue cap 12; non‑stationarity on.
- Prices, costs, yields, sizes as specified in code constants.
